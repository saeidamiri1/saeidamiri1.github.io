Saeid Amiri has experiences of working in academia and collaborating with non-academic partners. Like many research workers in Statistics, I have been working on different projects, part of them published as articles. I believe statistics lies at the core of modern applied science, so I would like to define statistics as "The science of doing another sciences". I enjoy programing, and possess expertise in many statistical softwares.
