I"`<p>Clustering is an unsupervised technique to find underlying structure in a dataset by grouping
data points into subsets that are as homogeneous as possible, clustering is a widely used unsupervised technique for identifying natural classes within a set of data. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.01183v2.pdf">Amiri et al. (2018)</a> proposed a clustering technique for general clustering problems including those that have non-convex clusters. The proposed is fully nonparametric and it generates clusters for a given desired number of clusters K. They also discussed estimating the size of cluster.</p>
