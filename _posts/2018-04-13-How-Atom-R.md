**Under construction**.

### Rbox
I want to share my experience of using Atom as my day-to-day text editor for whom need coding and typing.  This post inspired by  @benbalter's [How I Atom (for prose)](http://ben.balter.com/2016/12/23/atom-for-prose/),[ron4stoppable](http://blog.rohanshewale.me/post/2017/02/how-i-atom/) that discus Atom as a computing environment, thought I'd talk a bit coding in R.

I deployed a packaged [Rbox package](https://github.com/saeidamiri1/rbox/wiki) ,
it designed for running R in Atom editor.
Rbox defines the R grammar in Atom editor to work and facilitate with snippets.  The R's code in Atom can be run in see [run inline](https://github.com/saeidamiri1/rbox/wiki/Use-under-macOS) or via terminal. To run inline  install  [hydrogen](https://atom.io/packages/hydrogen), the package Hydrogen provides a modern approach of using Jupyter kernels in Atom. It lets you choose which codes (the whole file, a single line, and a selection) you want to run. To run the code using termianl, install[termination](https://atom.io/packages/termination). This package provides the access to the terminal in Atom and the code can be run in the terminal without leaving Atom.


### Editor  
Atom can be used as regular editor, you need to install appropriate packages.
* [Theme-switcher](https://atom.io/packages/theme-switcher) - Switch between dark and light themes, helpful if you ever work outside.
* [Minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap) - It provides a preview of the full source code.
* [Split]() - When working on a long text code, split (right click to select it) provides very useful method for working on different part of file.
* [Shortcut keys]() - Atom has several shortcut keys, look at settings>Keybindings for the existing shortcut keys in your Atom. A short review can be found in [Shortcuts](https://github.com/nwinkler/atom-keyboard-shortcuts), I often use **cmd+shift+d**: duplicate the selected code.
 **ctrl+F2**: mark the line\lines. **Cmd+/**:  inserts the comment character immediately in the beginning of line. IF your plain text is R, it adds \# at in front of line. **ctrl-tab (ctrl-shift-tab)**: move through the current open tabs (forward and backwards). **cmd-shift-p** to access the Command Palette. 


### Theme
Select an appropriate theme from settings>Themes. I personally use UI Theme: One Dark and Syntax Theme:  One Dark.



### Markdown
There's a number of Markdown-specific packages, I like [Markedown Previrew enhanced](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-enhanced) and [Markedown Previrew ](https://github.com/atom/markdown-preview) among many other.


### Linters
Linter compare the current file with a predefined structure. Rbox has Grammar that can show mistake in the script file, there is linter for R, I am not using it because it is very sensitive to the space between parentheses.

I like linter for spell checks.
@balter's ["How I Atom" post](https://ben.balter.com/2016/12/23/atom-for-prose/)  gave a short description, see below
> ##### Prose linters
>There are a few prose-specific linters I credit for improving my day-to-day writing:
> * [linter-write-good](https://atom.io/packages/linter-write-good) - A grammar linter, Write Good checks all sorts of things, like cliches, passive voice, and unnecessarily wordy phrases.
>* [linter-markdown](https://atom.io/packages/linter-markdown) - This linter, based on [Remark JS](https://github.com/gnab/remark) lints Markdown formatting, ensuring things like headings are surrounded by whitespace and bulleted lists are consistent.
>* [linter-alex](https://atom.io/packages/linter-alex) - [Alex](https://github.com/wooorm/alex) checks your writing for biased or insensitive language.
>* [linter-just-say-no](https://atom.io/packages/linter-just-say-no) - Discourages you from using hedge words that weaken's the impact of your writing.
